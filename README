Java project to study VRaptor. 

This project try to do something like Twitter do, but using Caelum's VRaptor 3. 

Another version of this project is in https://github.com/mariohd/Tweetlet, but using servlets instead of VRaptor.

The purpose of this project is to learn how VRaptor 3 works and compare with Servlet approach to see the differences.
